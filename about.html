We opened back in 2013, and have been a fairly small company until recently, but with a much higher demand for bubbles, and a desire for creativity we have found our way to the top of the bubble word.  We would like to thank those who bought our products earlier on, and who helped test our products, despite the testing being rather enjoyable and creative rather than a dull drag.  We began in northern California, and soon moved out east, but our roots in Cali have implanted in us a creative childishness that can not be found almost anywhere else, due to the very nature of California.  Our company was started by a single mother, and her children inspired her to conceptualize the rainbow of bubbles that we can now produce.
